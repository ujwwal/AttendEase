💡 How to Use It?
Simply click the **"AI Chat ✨"** button in the navigation bar (next to Mark & Notes) to start chatting with our AI assistant. Ask any questions about your attendance, and get intelligent insights instantly!

📊 Weekly AI Summaries
Starting this week, your weekly email reports now include an **AI-generated summary** at the bottom, offering personalized recommendations based on your attendance.

⚡ Fair Usage Policy
To ensure fair usage for all students, we've implemented a limit of **20 AI queries per day** per user.

🎯 Why This Matters?
Better insights = Better attendance decisions = Better academic performance!

We encourage you to explore this new feature and see how AI can help you stay on top of your attendance.
